# Semi-supervised learning using GANs

This notebook shows how a GAN can be used to do semi-supervised
training, where a large dataset is available for training, but only a
small amount of it is labeled.  The problem here is to classify
handwritten digits as one of 10 digits.  

This is done by making the discriminator train to classify
two problems - to tell real images from those generated by the
discriminator, and if the image is identified as real, to classify it
as one of ten digits.

Here, the discriminator is what is reatined as valuable (the generator
can be tossed after training), in contrast to the more common use of
GANs are generative models, where the valuable end-product of the
training is the generator (and the discriminator can be discarded).

The notebook is an implementation of the idea described in the 2016
paper [Improved Techniques for training
GANs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03498.pdf) by Tim Salimans, Ian
Goodfellow and co-workers and improves on the accuracy of a previous
attempt at using DCGANs for semi-supervised learning by Kingma et al
in 2014 [Semi-supervised learning with Deep Generative
Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.5298.pdf).
