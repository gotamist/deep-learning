# Semi-supervised learning using GANs

This notebook shows how a GAN can be used to do semi-supervised
training, where a large dataset is available for training, but only a
small amount of it is labeled.  The problem here is to classify
handwritten digits as one of 10 digits.

This is done by making the discriminator train to classify
two problems - to tell real images from those generated by the
discriminator, and if the image is identified as real, to classify it
as one of ten digits.

Here, the discriminator is what is valuable (the generator can be
tossed after training), in constrast to the more common use of GANs
are generative models, where the valuable end-product of the training
is the generator (and the discriminator can be discarded).
