# Generating a script

Here, I'm using Tensorflow to build an RNN model to learn from the
script of episodes of the TV series, The Simpsons, to be able to
generate a new scene that's in character with the series.

## Data

Using the [Simpson's dataset
](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data) hosted
by Kaggle. It contains scripts from 27 seasons of the Simpsons.
