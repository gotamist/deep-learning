The projects in this repository are exmaples of the use of deep neural
networks (DNN) to solve some challenging problems.
Five of the projects are ones that I did for Udacity's Deep Learning nanodegree program.

The projects are described briefly here.  For a more detailed
introduction, please see the README files within the subdirectory of
each project.

The projects are:
- A __convolutional neural network__ (CNN) that's trained on a database of
dog images and then, when shown a new dog image, can classify the dog
into one of 133 breeds. (Random guessing would have only a success rate of 1/133!).
- A __recurrent neural network__ (RNN), here, long short term memory cells
(LSTM), multiple stacked layers of them, used to learn from scripts
from the TV series 'The Simpsons' - only from scenes set in Moe's
tavern, to general a new script automatically. When the script is
trained on lines from all scenes (not just from Moe's Tavern), the
quality of the generated script improves.
- A __multi-level-perceptron__ (MLP) or _vanilla deep neural network_
  for predicting user data over time for a bike-sharing company.
- A __Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network__ (DCGAN) to
generate a bunch of human face images. The generator and discrimator
networks in this project are both CNNs.
- A __Reinforcement Learning__ (RL) problem using the actor-critic method to teach a
quadcopter how to perform a certain task (takeoff in this case).
